_The following is a mirror of an article I wrote in high school, 
which can be accessed for free at [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1n5l7Lh6rajZzRkQTcwcEpJdzQ/view?resourcekey=0-c_q1wp2y2-dwhQabdTT6nw).
It's not well-written or rigorous, but it's interesting to see what I thought at the time._

# Radically Revolutionary Robots: The Growing Obsolescence of Math in Modern Times

## Introduction

Cogito ergo sum - I think, therefore I am. This phrase has been the guiding principle of
human science and progress since the 17th century, starting with the scientific revolution,
which gave birth to the bountiful spring of classic mathematics. We have undoubtedly been
living in a golden age of rationalism and scientific thought. In the past century alone, humans
have ventured beyond our world, sending both man and machine on quests to learn more
about our universe, created machines capable of incredibly complex calculations in the blink
of an eye, and proliferated drugs engineered to save the lives of millions around the world. In
1959, the Apollo Guidance Computer (APG), manned by expert rocket scientists at NASA,
had approximately 64 kilobytes of memory and operated at around 2 megahertz. The latest
iPhone (the 7 plus, at the time of writing), by contrast, has up to 256 gigabytes of memory
and has a CPU clock of 2.34 gigahertz, or 4 million times the APG’s memory and 1170 times
the CPU clock speed.

Such a rapid increase in human technological prowess and accessibility begs the question:
How fast will technology improve in the future? Will the rate of technological growth de-
cline? Vernor Vinge, former mathematics and computer science professor at San Diego State
University and highly acclaimed science fiction author, asserts that humans “are on the edge
of [technological] change comparable to the rise of human life on Earth.” What does it feel
like to stand here?

It seems like a pretty intense place to be standing, but we have to remember that we can’t
actually see what is to our right and in our future. So actually it feels like this:

That seems normal, doesn’t it? Most of us don’t realize that we are on the cusp of a new Intel-
ligence age that will have far-reaching consequences, both intriguingly positive and brutally
severe. The automation of factories has irreparably decimated traditional manufacturing
occupations, and the rise of artificial intelligence is likely to extend the job destruction. In
fact, this glaring concern has led Elon Musk, co-founder of Paypal, Tesla, and Space-X, to
suggest that governments will be forced to mandate a universal basic income to support the
human population. Bill Gates, founder of Microsoft, has recently proposed that governments
start taxing robot workers the same way human employees are taxed. In 2013, two respected
Oxford economists published research indicating that up to 45% of all US jobs could be auto-
mated within the next 20 years. Evidently, humans are poised for an abrupt and unsettling
technological revolution. But what does this AI revolution mean for mathematicians and
mathematics as AI’s critical analysis capabilities improve exponentially? Will mathemati-
cians and engineers be obsolete? How, if at all, can mathematicians remain relevant in the
upcoming Intelligence age?

As we approach this AI revolution, it has become increasingly obvious that our mathematical
processes and rational reasoning must evolve with it.

## Math Education

The way we use math in our daily lives is changing - fast. Keith Delvin, co-founder and exec-
utive director of Stanford University’s Human-Sciences and Technologies Advanced Research
Institute, laments that mathematics education continues to lag far behind math’s evolution.
During the 20th century, mathematics education focused on mastery of a collection of stan-
dard procedures for solving well-defined problems with unique solutions. Suddenly, over the
span of a single generation, technological advances have renderd mastery of such procedural
math skills largely irrelevant. In fact, Devlin asserts that no one who wants to keep “a
good job can now ignore that shift from the old ‘application of known procedures’ to new
emphasis on creative problem solving.” Today, the ability to take “a novel problem, possibly
not well-defined, and likely not having a single ‘right’ answer, and make progress on it” is
far more valuable than mastery of standard procedures. As technology improves rapidly,
perhaps we must rely on what separates us from machines - creativity.

## Robotic Creativity

Historically, machine learning and machine intelligence has been exceptionally limited: com-
puters could extract powerful patterns from data, but only through a lens predefined by
humans using various filters. Similarly, machine creativity was relegated to using random
number generators to create arbitrary permutations and chains of options chosen by a human.
However, machine’s creativity has recently advanced to nearly human levels.
In fact, starting with the WaveNet research published in September 19, 2016, numerous
artificial intelligence composers have been developed, producing original music across all
musical genres. From board games to producing original movie scripts, artificial intelligence
is undoubtedly rivaling human creativity and intellect. Then this begs the question: How
long until a machine independently produces original scientific research? When will machine
surpass man? Notable visionaries such as Elon Musk are convinced that human intellect will
be obsolete in the near future.

## Conclusion

Sentience is traditionally not characteristic of machines. However, mathematics is the uni-
versal language, and one that machine, frankly, speaks far better than humans. Without
merging with this emerging technology, we risk intellectual obsolescence, especially with
outdated education and educational methods. Even though artificial intelligence prompts a
multitude of seemingly distant ethical and practical issues, it notably remains a vital compo-
nent of medical and scientific research. Thus, it is imperative that global legislation regulate
artificial intelligence in a manner that both allows research to progress with lightning efficiency
and prevents the sudden upset of civilization.
