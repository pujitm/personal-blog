      <h2>Legislaide</h2>
      <p>
        I was the technical cofounder at Legislaide and Chief Technology Officer until 2024. We made
        it simple for city and county government officials to generate policies, resolutions, and
        parliamentary stuff.

      <ul>
        <li>
          Built a policy-writing product based on GPT-4 for government use end-to-end, including
          design, frontend, backend, security, and infrastructure.
        </li>
        <li>
          Created Python tools for model analytics and training involving input from non-technical
          colleagues, improving bug resolution and feature development times over 10x.
        </li>
      </ul>
