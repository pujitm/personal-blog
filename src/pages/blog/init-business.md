# Starting a Business

The world would be a better place if more people had the knowledge to successfully start and operate a business.

I hope to increase any readers' odds of success in hopes that they will apply their own insights and skills to create a better world in their own way.

As a disclaimer, I am a nobody. I have no high-profile successes and am a mere student entering his third year of university as of writing this.
Despite my dubious credibility, I hope you will give me a chance and find my insight sensible and practical.

## Preface: The Pursuit of Truth

If you choose to pursue this endeavor, many "facts" will prove to be half-truths, or outright misleading. A quick example of this is profit.
It is not uncommon for profitable businesses to go bankrupt and close their doors (I will explain later).

These "facts" are quite dangerous because they can kill your business. Thus, you should prioritize--above all--the clear truth.
Let truth--not your optimism or apprehension--be your barometer for the quality of an input to a decision.

What do I mean? If you're taking

Seeing the truth is difficult. When this hardship is compounded by numerous inputs to innumerable decisions every day, your perception will distort over time.
In my opinion, this distortion can be mitigated and reduced, but it is impossible to eliminate.

Thus, your instincts will serve as the true final decision maker--whether you're conscious of it or not.

I used to be very afraid of this. To be honest, I still am.

I believed that my instincts were unhoned and unreliable; I equated them to a whim. Upon introspection, however, you will find that you have a "bullshit" barometer built into you.
This barometer will get more sensitive over time, and its triggers will evolve as well.

Basically, if something screams bullshit to you, it probably is. If something screams amazing to you, it is also probably bullshit.

So we have two instruments to help us make decisions--objective facts and our personal bullshit filter. How do we use them?

### Modes of Operation

There are two main modes of making decisions (both in and outside of business): reasonable until proven bullshit (RUB) & bullshit until proven reasonable (BUR). These are the "rubber" modes that you should flex between.

Let's take a glance at (the gist of) their tradeoffs.

**RUB**: This is the optimistic approach. Upon first glance, its vulnerability to manipulation is obvious. Giving "blind" credence to an unproven statement
is a dubious tactic and certainly contrary to academic and scientific standards. However, this approach can be tremendously rewarding. It will save your business from tough times and help you get (and stay) ahead of your competition.

Without RUB, your business will be slow, grow stale, and head towards death. Too much of it, and your business will suffer sharp, quick, and potentially fatal consequences.

**BUR**: This is the pessimistic approach. It may seem more robust, rational, and level-headed, but it is also quite susceptible to manipulation, especially ego-based manipulation.

BUR will reduce risk of catastrophe, but it will also reduce the likelihood of innovation. Your decision-making and operating speed will decrease, but you will be a bit safer.

Different situations call for different mixes of rubbur (_sic_).

It is common for social and professional climates to influence this mix. I believe this is dangerous to your business because it pollutes your process of getting to the truth with factors you don't control, making it more difficult to evaluate and improve your mix's effectiveness.
You can control how you change with some effort, but it is far more difficult to change an entire society.

In my opinion, leaders with "great foresight" or "vision" are often those who stick to their own philosophy/system when others are swept away by shifting cultural or professional systems. These leaders develop a system to apply different mixes in certain situations.

Contrary to what my acquaintances perceive and parents likely believe, I am naturally quite risk-averse. My personal mix follows this general structure:

If the statement being said to me is hopeful, use more BUR than usual.

> If we use X strategy, we'll double our sales in a quarter.

If it's pessimistic or scary, use more RUB.

> This virus could spread extremely quickly. There's no cure. We should close university campuses.

If it's something I'm knowledgeable about, rely more on BUR.

> Write your code in the MVC pattern because it's best practice.

If it's something I know nothing about, use RUB and ask questions to understand fundamentals.

> My new dating app will be tremendously successful because our business model is stronger.
>
> You shouldn't hire that contractor because it could cause payroll complications.

I came to this mix via my life and business experiences and anecdotes from other founders and investors that I deemed weren't riding on the cultural momentum of startups. Perhaps a bit ironically, I found Paul Graham's writing compelling (ADD LINK).

My current process is being rigorously rational with the inputs to my decisions before letting my instincts and emotions make the final decision.

<!-- When I started my first business as a 16 year old, I was eager to accept advice from professionals and online forums in and outside my field (security and server administration).
It worked, really, really well at first. Then, I gradually started to lean more on the (mostly positive) experiences I acquired, which effectively bankrupted my business after a couple of misguided decisions (after about 18 months since it started).

As a result, I decided to be more cautious and give my experiences less weight.

Enter my first semester of college. Two friends in my corridor decided to start an esports merchandising business with me. Honestly, I thought it would go nowhere because I thought only ambitious startups could see a ton of success.

Surprisingly, we had productive conversations with several big organizations, such as Team Solo Mid and Tempo Storm.

All of a sudden, we were talking to executives at organizations we sincerely admired. Unfortunately, we had no idea how
contracts or intellectual property agreements actually worked in this context. As talks became more serious, our inexperience grew increasingly apparent to our opposing parties, who politely
rejected us after giving much-appreciated advice and insight into the esports business climate.

Our morale fizzled out, and we decided to drop the venture.

After a while, we discussed what went wrong, and we concluded that if we lacked enough industry experience to convert clients and deliver on our promises.

Disregarding the accuracy of our conclusion, I learned that experience was really valuable too. -->

> Side Note: The "If it's something I know nothing about" part in particular may have saved my life. I didn't take the covid pandemic seriously when it started, but my cofounder at the time, Chris Lally, took it extremely seriously.
> After our conversations, I decided to give his network's sentiment more weight than my skepticism and optimism (this is hard as an engineer). As a result, I took extra caution in the weeks preceding our university's decision to
> close campus.

I hope you understand that business is neither a courtroom nor a science lab. It has elements of both.
Thus, balancing arrogant skepticism and naiive hope is important.

But that's enough theory for now. Let's get more practical.
